# OData WebApi Spatial Sample
-----------------------------------

This sample demonstrates OData Spatial type in Web API.

It illustrates how to:

1. Build the edm model with spatial types
2. Convert between DB Spatail types and Edm Spatial types
3. EF & EF Core related operations.

Be noted, EF Core doesn't support Spatial data types (see [issue](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1100))

------------------

This sample includes two versionsï¼š

* AspNetClassic : For .NET Framework version with EF
* AspNetCore : For .NET Core version with EF Core

## AspNetClassic

It's .NET Framework Console application hosting a Web API service depending on `Microsoft.AspNet.OData` nuget package.

When it runs, it does the following requests:

1. GET ~/$metadata
2. GET ~/Customers(2)
3. GET ~/Customers?&$filter=geo.intersects(Location, geography'SRID=4326;POLYGON((0 0, 0 3, 3 3, 3 0, 0 0))')
4. POST ~/Customers?&$filter=geo.intersects(Location, geography'SRID=4326;POLYGON((0 0, 0 1.5, 1.5 1.5, 1.5 0, 0 0))')
5. PUT ~/Customers

for example, for request #4, you will get the following output:

```C#
[Request]: Customers?&$filter=geo.intersects(Location, geography'SRID=4326;POLYGON((0 0, 0 1.5, 1.5 1.5, 1.5 0, 0 0))')
[StatusCode]: OK
[Content]:
{"@odata.context":"http://localhost/odata/$metadata#Customers","value":[{"Location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0],"crs":{"type":"name","properties":{"name":"EPSG:4326"}}},"LineString":{"type":"LineString","coordinates":[[1.0,1.0],[3.0,3.0]],"crs":{"type":"name","properties":{"name":"EPSG:4326"}}},"Id":1,"Name":"Mercury"}]}

```

## AspNetCore

It's an ASP.NET Core Web Application depending on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData` nuget package.

When it runs, you can use any client tool (for example `POSTMAN`) to file request:

```C#
GET http://localhost:5000/odata/Customers
```

Also, you can post a customer as:

```C#
POST http://localhost:5000/odata/Customers
Content-Type: application/json
Content:
```

```json
{
    "Location": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [
                    4,
                    5,
                    6,
                    7
                ],
                "crs": {
                    "type": "name",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": "EPSG:4326"
                    }
                }
            },
    "Id": 9,
    "Name": "Aury"
}
```
