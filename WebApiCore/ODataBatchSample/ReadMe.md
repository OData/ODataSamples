ODataBatchSample
-----------------

This sample shows how to use request batching in multipart/mixed and JsonBatch format based on WebApi
for AspNetCore ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData/)). 
Batching is a Web API feature that allows a customer to pack several API requests and send them to the Web API
service in one HTTP request and receive a single HTTP response with the response to all
their requests. This way, the client can optimize calls to the server and improve the 
latency and scalability of its service.

The sample consists of three parts:
- Sample service for batch requests.
- Sample client using batch in Json format.
- Sample client using batch in the multipart/mixed format.

Sample service creates test data from scratch when service is started by dropping the existing database and 
re-creating the new database using EntityFrameworkCore in SQL Server MSSQLLocalDB.
