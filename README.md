##Introduction

The underlying model for this service is TripPin which is designed to cover almost every important features OData V4 and to be as real as possible. The class diagram for TripPin is below

We have a [read-write TripPin service online](http://services.odata.org/V4/TripPinServiceRW) which is implemented directly using ODataLib. You can refer to [Basic Tutorials](http://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/) and [Advanced Tutorial](http://www.odata.org/getting-started/advanced-tutorial/) to know OData V4 and this service.
