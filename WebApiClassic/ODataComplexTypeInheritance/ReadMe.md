ODataComplexTypeInheritanceSample
------------------


It illustrates the complex type inheritance requests, such as:
1. Query a property which is defined in a derived complex type
2. Function that returns a base complex type
3. Action that takes in a base complex type
4. Add an entity which contains derived complex type instance
5. Add a member of base complex type to a collection.

To exercise the sample, just start project with F5.

Other REST client tools such as Postman can also be used.
