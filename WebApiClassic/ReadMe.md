ODataComplexTypeInheritanceSample
------------------


It illustrates the complex type inheritance requests, such as:
1. Query a property which is defined in a derived complex type
2. Function that returns a base complex type
3. Action that takes in a base complex type
4. Add an entity which contains derived complex type instance

To exercise the sample, just start project with F5. 

Other REST client tools such as Postman can also be used.
